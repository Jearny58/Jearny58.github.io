subtitle: Who am I?

My name is Joe Earnshaw and my journey up to this point has been somewhat of a whirlwind. From my start in tech, to teaching English in Central America and now helping others create healthier lifestyles as a CrossFit coach, I've been exposed to a wide range of work experiences. For an outsider, these vastly different occupations can appear haphazard with no unifying direction. Yet...

Every experience has helped me understand who I am a little better and what I should do. My first 'dot' was at Oracle, where I got my first experience with technologies like cloud computing, machine learning, and AI, and their potential to positively affect so many lives. My next 'dot' was teaching English in Costa Rica. It was here that I finally began to understand and appreciate the incredible power that continual learning and knowledge could have on one's life. The student's willingness to come in every day and get a little bit better also showcased how important grit is in the process improving ourselves. 

In my current role as a CrossFit coach I've had the opportunity to help others create healthier, and as a result happier, lives. And I don't say that lightly; being able to see people go from having difficulties doing simple activities like getting around the house to playing with their kids (or grandkids) is incredibly awesome!

Now, what's next? Well, these three 'dots' of wisdom -- the power of today's technology, the value of continual learning and helping others optimize their lives -- have culminated into a desire to try and help as many people as possible through technology. After taking Springboard's Introduction to Data Science course, I discovered that as a Data Scientist I would have the potential to do just that. 

This next chapter has just begun and I understand that there is still much to learn but am nonetheless extremely excited to see where this journey takes me!
