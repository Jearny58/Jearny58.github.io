title: What Is Deep Learning?
---
Deep learning. Hard to believe how mysterious (and scary) those two words used to be for me. Luckily though, after completing my second capstone project in Springboard's Data Science Career Track program, I feel a lot more comfortable with what it is and what it can do. While it is a field that is going through a lot of changes due to a significant increase in research, I'm going to do my best to explain what it is from a high level and then maybe go into the weeds a little bit to describe its nuances.
