title: What Is Deep Learning?
---
Deep learning. Hard to believe how mysterious (and scary) those two words used to be for me. Luckily though, after completing my second capstone project in Springboard's Data Science Career Track program, I feel a lot more comfortable with what it is and what it can do. While it is a field that is going through a lot of changes due to a significant increase in research, I'm going to do my best to explain what it is from a high level and then maybe go into the weeds a little bit to describe its nuances. 

## A little backgound

My journey into deep learning started when I decided to follow along with the [first part](https://course.fast.ai/) of fast.ai's course _Practical Deep Learning for Coders_. What is really cool about what the team at fast.ai is doing is providing an approachable course for individuals like me, i.e. those who don't have Masters/PhD's, to learn deep learning. 

What is different about this course is that they approach it in a top-down fashion. In other words, you get to start doing deep learning from the very [first lesson](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1). Now I know some may question this approach but first I want to ask you a simple question: how did you learn to walk? 

Did you first study the biomechanics of the human body and what is biologically necessary for us to put one foot in front of the other? What about physics? Because walking is also a complicated interaction between things like friction, pressure and force.

No, you didn't learn these things. You just started walking. 

It was far from an overnight process though; maybe you first learned to roll over, then you started to pull yourself up using a nightstand. After reaching a few progressively harder milestones, you started to walk on your own. 

By showing us what is capable from day one, fast.ai is able to tap into the individual's imagination which is a huge motivator to continue learning. As you progress the material does dive deeper into the nuances of deep learning. However, they are there with you all the way as you continue deeper into the jungle that is deep learning. Now just imagine having Rambo as your guide in the jungle. That is how helpful fast.ai is.
