## The Journey Begins: July 1st, 2019


Finally got up the courage to start this! We all got to start somewhere and this is my first step, at least when it comes to blogging...

I digress, let's get the introduction out of the way. 

My name is Joe, and I'm a...

Sike!

My journey up to this point has been somewhat of a whirlwind, and is probably a story for another day. The primary purpose for today's post is to relay some pretty cool developments that took place today! 

I'm currently a part of [Springboard's](https://www.springboard.com/) Data Science Career Track. The curriculm is pretty extensive - it ranges from learning the basics of Python and statistical inference to using tools like MapReduce for large-scale data manipulation. On the side I've also been following along with [fast.ai's](https://www.fast.ai/) __Practical Deep Learning for Coders__ course. 

As a part of Springboard, you have to create two capstone projects. My [first capstone](https://github.com/Jearny58/Springboard-DS-Portfolio/tree/master/capstone_1/basketball) took NBA player data and was able to very accurately predict a respective player's win share per 48 minutes, which is a metric that indicates a players contribution towards his team winning. 

Now I'm on my second capstone, and this is where the material I've been learning via Springboard and fast.ai have come together. Stanford recently released one of the largest publically available data sets of chest x-rays in an attempt to encourage further research of deep learning specifically when it comes to medical imaging. Despite being slightly intimidated by the task - there were roughly __224,000__ images in the data set - I took the leap. 

### My Daily Progress

My second capstone is a classification problem that is attempting to answer a relatively simple question: is there a certain pathology - in this case, [cardiomegaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomegaly) - present in a specific medical image?

Utilizing fast.ai's deep learning software, which is built on top of PyTorch, I've been working on the project for the past few weeks, as you can see with all my 'trial' [notebooks](https://github.com/Jearny58/Springboard-DS-Portfolio/tree/master/capstone_2/playground_nbs). The way I saw it the more experimenting I did, and the faster my iterations got, the more likely I was to potentially find something that could get good results. 

Now the primary metric I'm using to judge the performance of the model is the __'Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics'__ curve, or perhaps more succintly known as AUROC. Without going into too much detail, what this curve represents is how well the model distinguished between classes. It takes a value between 0 and 1 





From my start in tech to teaching English in Central America and now helping others create healthier lifestyles as a CrossFit coach, I've been exposed to a wide range of work experiences. For an outsider, these vastly different occupations can appear haphazard with no unifying direction. However, "you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward" (Steve Jobs). 

Every experience has helped me understand who I am a little better and what I should do. My first 'dot' was at Oracle, where I got my first experience with technologies like cloud computing, machine learning, and AI, and their potential to positively affect so many lives. My next 'dot' was teaching English in Costa Rica. It was here that I finally began to understand and appreciate the incredible power that continual learning and knowledge could have on one's life. The student's willingness to come in every day and get a little bit better also showcased how vital grit is in the process of improving ourselves. 

In my current role as a CrossFit coach, my primary function is to help others create healthier, and as a result, happier, lives. I don't say that lightly. It has allowed me to see people go from having difficulties doing simple activities like getting around the house to playing with their kids (or grandkids), which has been an incredible experience!

Now, what's next? Well, these three 'dots' of wisdom -- the power of today's technology, the value of continual learning and helping others optimize their lives -- have culminated into a desire to try and help as many people as possible through technology. After taking Springboard's Introduction to Data Science course, I discovered that as a Data Scientist, I would have the potential to do just that. 

This next chapter has just begun, and there is still much to learn, but I'm incredibly excited to see where this journey takes me.
