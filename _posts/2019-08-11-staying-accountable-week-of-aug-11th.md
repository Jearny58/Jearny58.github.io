### How did I do from last week?

Almost forgot to review my weekly goals! When you're getting started with any new activity/habit, the hardest thing is often just doing the work. Well, here I am putting in the work! 

As a reminder here were the 3 primary goals from the week of August 4th, 2019:

__1. Complete the comprehensive analysis for my second capstone project__

__2. Review for mock interviews__

__3. 30 minutes of [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) per day__

As a check mark of sorts, here is the [link](https://github.com/Jearny58/Springboard-DS-Portfolio/blob/master/capstone_2/reports/final_report.pdf) that will take you to the final comprehensive analysis for my second capstone project. Additionally, I've officially completed 100% of the curriculum! Which brings me to my next point...

As part of Springboard's Data Science curriculum, the student must conduct four mock interviews with various contexts, which include: behavioral, general data science, project walkthrough, and technical. Conducted by Springboard mentor's, the goal of these interviews is to give a better idea of what the interview process is like and to assess the skills you've built over the past 6+ months. I feel pretty good going into both the general DS and project walkthrough interviews; for the technical, I'm a little nervous about it and is why I've devoted most of my time to reviewing the following Python concepts:

- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Flow control (if-else, for, while loops)
- [`itertools`](https://pymotw.com/3/itertools/) library
- [`collections`](https://pymotw.com/3/collections/) library

While I haven't covered all of them just yet, I've got a pretty good start. You can check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Jearny58/Springboard-DS-Portfolio/tree/master/unit17-take-home-challenges/technical_interview_review/data_structures) of some 'study' Jupyter Notebooks.

Long story, short: I accomplised my second goal for the week! 

Unfortunately, I did **not** get 30 minutes a day of [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) each day. I did do it once...

However, two out of three for my first week? Not too bad. 

## 3 Main Goals For This Week

__1. Conduct my general data science and project walkthrough mock interviews__

I have my general data science interview tomorrow at nine in the morning and then my project walkthrough at the next day! 

__2. Continue 'vanilla' Python Review__

For the technical interview, we **cannot** use libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, etc. Instead, we are limited to the 'basic' libraries like the ones listed above. Having spent most of my time using the 'non-vanilla' libraries, I need to reacquant myself with the more foundational concepts. Specifically, I need complete the Notebooks for `itertools` and `collections`, and reorganize the repository to make it look a little bit nicer. 

__3. Work on [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) Kaggle Competition__

I've already produced some initial models that have produced decent results. This competition provides another opportunity to keep learning about deep learning and to push my skillset even further! Specficially, my goal is to devote at least one hour a day to experimentation.
