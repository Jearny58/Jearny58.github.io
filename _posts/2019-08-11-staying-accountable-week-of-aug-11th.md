### How did I do from last week?

Almost forgot to review my weekly goals! When you're getting started with any new activity/habit, the hardest thing is often just doing the work. Well, here I am putting in the work! 

As a reminder here were the 3 primary goals from the week of August 4th, 2019:

__1. Complete the comprehensive analysis for my second capstone project__

__2. Review for mock interviews__

__3. 30 minutes of [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) per day__

As a check mark of sorts, here is the [link](https://github.com/Jearny58/Springboard-DS-Portfolio/blob/master/capstone_2/reports/final_report.pdf) that will take you to the final comprehensive analysis for my second capstone project. Additionally, I've officially completed 100% of the curriculum! 

For my second goal, I think I should expand a little further. As part of Springboard's curriculum
