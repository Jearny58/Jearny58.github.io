"So tell me a little bit more about your background..."

Who knew that such an innocent, seemingly simple request could be so baffling. 

I'm currently in the final stages of Springboard's Data Science Career Track and to prepare us for the job search that most will be undertaking imminently, the Career Services team conducts mock behavioral and technical interviews.

I just completed my "behavioral" interview, and while not perfect, my career coach rated the performance as 'good,' with a few areas to focus on improving for future interviews. But it was that first question she asked me, the one from above, that unexpectedly hit me in the gut and took the wind out of my sails for a second. After all, how does one sum up their life's experiences into a roughly 1-2 minute monologue?

Over these past few days, this simple request has made me come to terms with the fact that I hadn't dug deep enough to try and figure out the plotline of my story. That's going to change here. 

## Connecting the Dots

Firstly, have you listened to Steve Jobs 2005 Stanford commencement speech? If you haven't, I highly recommend you check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UF8uR6Z6KLc?start=47).

### Have you watched it yet? I'm in no rush...

For those of you that have watched it, you know that one of the stories Jobs talks about is his decision to drop out of Reed College. I imagine for a lot of people, especially in that particular era (the early 70s), would not consider this a "smart" decision. After all, a college degree is the way to the American Dream, right...? Plus, Jobs even admitted to being pretty scared upon dropping out, 

Jobs was scared upon making his decision to drop out. What's that saying though, "when one door closes, another opens..." This decision to drop out had presented Jobs with the opportunity to drop-in on classes he was genuinely interested in exploring, like calligraphy. This class introduced him to the world of typography, which he found utterly fascinating and 'artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture.'

But was this practical? In other words, could Jobs take his newfound writing skills and make a living from it? No, yet those skills would prove extremely valuable nonetheless, ten years later. 

The aspects of calligraphy that he found so beautiful were etched into his psyche that they were designed into what would become the first Macintosh computer, which helped launch the personal computer revolution. 

Jobs said in his speech that "[if] [he] had never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do." But it was the next few sentences that caught my eye. Here they are, in their entirety:

> You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something. Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path. And that will make all the difference.

My story is a little different than Jobs. The most obvious difference is that he was the driving force behind what is now one of the most influential companies on the face of the earth, and I'm not entirely on that level yet...

Another more nuanced difference though is that I traded calligraphy for teaching English and sleeping underneath volcanoes, and coaching CrossFit. I imagine my experiences so far in life appear somewhat chaotic, almost like random noise; for a long time, they seemed that way to me as well. But now when I look back, I'm starting to connect the dots. 

Every experience of mine has allowed me to understand the world a little bit more clearly, and what role I can play in this grand game that we call life. 

My first 'dot' was at Oracle. While being in sales and a cubicle wasn't exactly my cup of tea, I got to go behind the curtain of the modern technological revolution taking place today, and learn about things like cloud computing, machine learning, and AI, and their enormous potential for good. 

My next 'dot' was teaching English in Costa Rica. As much as I hate to say it when I was in college, I didn't truly appreciate the opportunity I had to learn with no other purpose than to gain a greater understanding of how the world worked. However, the months I spent in Quepos, a small seaside town on the countries west coast, were profound. It was here that I finally began to understand and appreciate the incredible power that continual learning and knowledge could have on one's life. The student's willingness to come in every day and get a little bit better also showcased how vital grit was in the process of improving ourselves.

The last 'dot' is in my current role as a CrossFit coach. This opportunity has given me the chance to help others create healthier, and as a result, happier, lives. And I don't say that lightly. Seeing people go from having difficulties doing simple activities like getting around the house to playing with their kids (or grandkids) is incredibly awesome! 

All of these points have led me to my next step, into the world of data. Data science is an exciting field in that we get to ask the following question: why? 

We get to question how the world works and use data to try and answer them. Perhaps more importantly, data scientists don't merely crunch this data or create machine learning models; they tell stories. For me, the data is not merely numbers in a CSV file; they're unique points that can tell us a story about us, i.e., humanity, or the world around us. 

With every data set comes the potential for yet undiscovered stories, and I'm fascinated by this fact. I'm looking forward to this next step and trusting that there will be many more dots to connect in the future!
