Back in 2005 Steve Jobs gave perhaps one of the best commencement speeches in recent history. If you haven't seen it yet I highly advise [taking a look]((https://www.youtube.com/embed/UF8uR6Z6KLc?start=47) before going any further. 

Towards the beginning, Jobs talks about 'connecting the dots' and the example he uses is his dropping out of college and dropping in on a calligraphy class. Seems somewhat random at first, and unpractical. After all, what can you do with that? Yet, this 'calligraphy' dot would stay with him until about ten years later, when it was programmed into the first Macintosh computer. 

Jobs says it perfectly: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards." 

I've been connecting my own dots, but instead of calligraphy I was teaching English, sleeping underneath volcanoes, to now coaching CrossFit. My first important 'dot' though was working at Oracle. I got to see behind the curtain so to speak as I got first-hand exposure to technolgies like cloud computing and AI for the first time. 

My second dot was in Costa Rica, where I got to teach English. It was here that I finally begain to understand and appreciate the incredible power that continual learning and knowledge could have on one's life.

My last 'dot' is in my current role as a CrossFit coach. It has given me the opporuntity to help others create healthier, and happier, lives. Seeing people go from having difficulties doing simple activities like getting around the house to playing with their kids (or grandkids) is incredibly awesome!

Somehow these dots have led me to here, into the world of data. Over roughly the past year, I've lived data science through Springboard's Data Science Career Track. One important thing that I've come to realie though is that data scientists don’t merely crunch data or create machine learning models; they help tell stories, especially on a platform like Twitter. 

With every data set comes the potential for yet undiscovered stories, and I’m fascinated by this fact. I’m looking forward to this next step and hopefully finding my next 'dot' at Twitter! 

Thank you for your time,
Joseph
