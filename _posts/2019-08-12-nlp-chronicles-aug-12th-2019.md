### NLP Review

It has come to my attention that I need a little work on my NLP (natural language processing) skills. I admit that I haven't been the best at keeping this particualr skillset up-to-date, but that is going to change and that change starts today. 

I'm going to start by reviewing an assignment from Unit 10 of Springboard's Data Science course, [Basic Text Classification with Naive Bayes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jearny58/Springboard-DS-Portfolio/blob/master/unit10-machine-learning/naive-bayes-predicting-movie-ratings/naive_bayes/Mini_Project_Naive_Bayes.ipynb). This assignments uses a subset of movie reviews from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) to classify whether or not a movie is 'fresh' or not.
